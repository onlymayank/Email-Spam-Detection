# Email-Spam-Detection
---
## Overview
This repository focuses on developing and implementing an Email Spam Detection system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to create an effective model that can classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

## Data
The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam emails. The dataset includes features extracted from the email text, such as word frequency, presence of specific keywords, and other relevant attributes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the email data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, identify patterns, and gain insights into the characteristics of each class.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the email content, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values, to represent the text in a format suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Development:** Implement machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models, to classify emails into spam or non-spam categories.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tune the models for optimal results.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the final model as part of an email filtering system, making it ready for real-world use.
